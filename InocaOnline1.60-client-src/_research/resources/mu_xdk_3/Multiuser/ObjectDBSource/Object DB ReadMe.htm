<h2>Introduction</h2>
This package contains sample source code for the Shockwave Multiuser Server's 
Object DB xtra. This is the xtra that implements the object database server commands.
<p>This code is provided as an example of a server xtra for your education and 
  modification. Macromedia is not able to answer technical support questions concerning 
  the use of this code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Code Summary<br>
</h2>
<p>The xtra uses the Sequiter Codebase engine as a back-end database. This database 
  contains information about the attributes, users, applications, and the actual 
  stored information. Since this is a 3rd-party licensed product, the actual library 
  and include files are not part of this distribution. If you are interested, 
  you may purchase the Codebase library from Sequiter.</p>
<p>The main server/xtra interface is in the SrvExtension.cpp file.</p>
<p>The back-end databases contain the following information: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Applications - maps between an application name and ID number<br>
    AppData - maps between an data ID and application ID<br>
    AttrList - maps between an attribute name and ID<br>
    Attributes - has info about attributes (owner ID, size, etc)<br>
    IDTable - keeps track of the internal ID numbers<br>
    Players - maps user ID &amp;amp; application ID to a player ID<br>
    RawData - has actual attribute data<br>
    Users - has User's name, internal ID and password</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ODB*.cpp files are abstract implementation of these tables, while the DBCB_*.cpp 
  files are the actual tables using the Codebase library.</p>
<p>This table architecture and lookup methods are excellent candidates for improvement 
  and replacement with a modern back-end database such as an SQL system.</p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>To build the object database, use the instructions provided with the server 
  XDK. Some of the files included here are the same as the common ones from the 
  XDK; they are provided to make a more complete package.</p>
<p>For compiling, the following values are #defined for all builds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>WINDLL<br>
    _WINDLL</code></p>
  <p><code>WINVER=0x0400<br>
    _WINVER=0x0400<br>
    WINDOWS<br>
    _WINDOWS<br>
    WIN32<br>
    _WIN32</code></p>
  <p><code>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  For debug builds, the following additional values are #defined:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>DEBUG<br>
    _DEBUG<br>
    TEST<br>
    _TEST<br>
    XDEBUG=1</code></p>
</blockquote>

  For release builds, the following additional values are #defined:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>RELEASE<br>
    _RELEASE<br>
    NDEBUG<br>
    _NDEBUG<br>
    XDEBUG=0</code></p>
