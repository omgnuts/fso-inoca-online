Hmm. Ok, here’s how CTF works.
 - person who wants to start CTF, must pay say 50k or some amount to get a CTF key
 - when its in the inventory he can either click "use" to start teh CTF or type /CTFstart otherleadersname
 - once it starts both leaders can invite/kick their players (no time limit to this)
 - once u are ready say even 2-3 days later and arrange the time to be 3pm
 - u guys meet up, one leader types /CTFKickoff otherleadersname
 - the other leader has to accept then the game starts
 - and only those players on the ctflist, who are online will be warped to the CTF
 - late comers will not be accepted, or u can use kick to change players at the last min
 - will allow CTF games to be scheduled

Marle's input
=========================
Fire shield - make it more firelike, maybe make it look as if its burning on the characters hand or atleast make it look as if its burning hot, like the firesword.
Fire helm - same as above; it doesnt look as if its a fire armor, make it look hot.
Ice shield - same as above; though it should look ice cold.
Ice helm - same as above, needs to look colder.
