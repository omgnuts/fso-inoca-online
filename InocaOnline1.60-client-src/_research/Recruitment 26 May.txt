Hi,
I live in Portugal, im usually online on afternoons and night (in my time zone).
I would like to be an officer because I believe I can help players and other officers make Inoca a better place, I also believe I can be respected. Ive playing a friend's fso some time ago for like 2 months i think (game died sad.gif ) so, i think i have some experience about this game. I have never been a staff member in any fso, but i would like to start on this one.

I'm 17 years, i'm not english/american but I can write decent english (ive been playing on internet since i was like 9 yrs old).
I'm not that kind of person that cuss or call names, be agressive, i respect other players and i usally help others around. I'm tolerant and comprehensive with everyone.
If i have more to say, i'll make other post tongue.gif

Thank you,

CLima

I have played many FSO's in the few months since I first found my first. I spend alot of time ingame and try my best to get along both with players and Admins. It is important to have earned respect from both sides. i am not hotheaded and try to view both sides before making a decision.
I never even considered this type of position before but I feel at home in this game and really want to help make it the best game going with no other able to come close to it. i know nothing about officer commands and can learn quick. I would even be willing to be put on a porbation period while learning and being observed by Admins and mappers with there opinions asked before being made a ful officer.
I thank you for the time and consideration you have shown in viewing and making your decision on my request will wait patiently for your response.

How long are you online for{internet time}: 1-8+ hours / day GMT -07:00 (mountian)

Why should we accept you?

i haven't been playng FSO games for very long however, i really enjoy playing them. The first one i played was FH, I had very recently been promoted to admin but when the hosts were no longer able to host, i needed to find another FSO to get addicted to. the spriteing in this game is really good, compared to alot of other servers, and because of this, if the comunitiy is even half of what fh was i will be firmly planted in frount of my computer for months to come. tho so far as i have seen every one is easy to get along with, and make waiting for future improvements to the game a little easier. blink.gif


Why are you good at this job?

I try to be helpful to anyone who needs it. I am really not shy of putting my foot down when i think some one has somhow made the game less enjoyable for others. I do my best to follow the rules and I expect the same from others. I am an Artist by trade and a wannabe writer. i am way above the learning curve at most things i set out to do (at least i think so, I'm at least, at or a little over the curve)

Screensot's if any: None

Games you worked on: FH (however breifly) i really wish i had time to get to learn more, at least the mapping end.


Thank you for your consideration!
i hope to have as much time for playing this game as i did for (the late) FH

you stole the server's owner so thins game must be good,lol.

See you all in game.

I would like to become an officer for Inoca, provided that it doesn't affect the status and playability of my character, Naruto, currently in use. (Meaning that the staff member status can be added to my character without having to make a new one to get it, my score is approaching 900 points, if you know what I mean)

For starters, I am experienced in FSO games such as TerraWorld, Factions, and Inoca. Some of the staff may remember me from Terra, playing as GenjutsuNaruto. Also, I play this game very frequently, meaning I will be there to keep order WHEN the number of steady players increases. My time zone is Eastern Standard (Florida, USA)

I have also taken the liberty of informing staff members of several bugs and errors, including the vault bug that JT is trying to fix, which I chose not to exploit for gold and items, which Eyeballs can vouch for. (I think it was him that I informed) sections of uncuttable trees in the LumberJack area, and that alchemic potions cannot be mixed although potion bottles and sand are available because of the word "equip" instead of "mix".

I'll be available anytime if my application is taken into consideration, but preferably if the the condition mentioned in the first paragraph is meetable as I presume that it is. I have no moderating experience, I'm afraid - but there is a first time for everything.

I'm Galana, slight noob to this game, yet an ex elite player of Terra World sort of. ah well, select me for your team, id be a valuable addition, since the fact im on my copmputer for 6+ hours a day n always ready and efficient to carry out new work/tasks and able to get them done without hassle and time lost. If chosen i'd help people everywhere on the game, yet still keeping within the guidelines of the game and enforce the rules to no end monitoring each player for signs of mishaps and wrong doings, keeping everyone within their boundaries. If made an elite member as it were, i'd keep upmost respect for all players and help them whenever needed, whilst not giving away the plot and spoling the game for them.
I'd keep adding people to your gaming member list and advertise it on my website, n quite a few of my friends' sites. I have great knowledge of the gaming and computing industry and will put it to effective use in helping make the game a friendly environemnt for all players, and keep them coming back. I have past experiences with many MMORPG games, such as Terra, SWG, PE and Ogre Island.
I am 16 years old moving on to 17, and im nerly always on my computer, unless i have school, then im cut short down on the time im on. I'm from the UK and have great knowledge on programming etc. So guys if u want a valid member and addition to your team pick me... i'll show you wat im made of for helping you make your game immortal. lol.

Hello, this is WindUser. I am applying for an Officer position on Inoca Online. I think that I would make a good Officer because I am able to hold my temper, and I rarely get mad. I am a very nice player and will treat all other players with respect. I will also help all the players who need it and answer any question that may arise during the game play. I am on usually online everyday between 4-8pm eastern standerd time, and as you can see, I have good gramatical skills. I appreciate you taking the time to review my application. I hope you consider me for an Officer and I wish you have a good rest of the day.

Hey all. Well, i guess this is my application! biggrin.gif

The time your normally online and what time zone your in
Well, on Monday to Friday, I have school from 7:00AM to 2:30PM. I am usually on anytime from 3:00PM to 12:00PM for about 2-3 hours. On the weekends im am usually on about 3-7 hours if not more! biggrin.gif

Why you believe you deserve a staff position

I believe that i deserve a position as mapper because i just love to map. I am currently 16 years old, and feel i am mature enough to handle almost any situation that might come my way. I am very experienced with the rules and limitations of this postion, for i have mapped on many other games which i will elaborate more on in the "Experience" section. Anyways, i just feel i could help out so very much with the game.

What experience you have.

I have been playing FSO and other games for about 3 years now and am absolutally obsessed!! I have been mapper/admin on about 6 games now. (I will not list then due to NO ADVERTISING, but most of those games, shaz has also plays so she will know biggrin.gif ) So pretty much, ive been playing this for a LONG time. ninja.gif

What you believe you can bring to Inoca Online.

This game seems to be off to a great start, and u guys are doing an amazing job! I beleive my creativity and maturty can make it even that much better!

Must atleast be 14 years of age

I am 16... huzza, I made the cut!! tongue.gif biggrin.gif

Must have good grammatical skills

^^ You can all evaluate my grammatical skills from my above and below work.

Must be generally nice and not a nuisance to players

I almost always keep my cool and just about any situation. I like to have the respect of my fellow gamers and friends. Just so u all know... I DO NOT TOLERATE ANY RACIST COMMENTS/JOKES whatsoever!! angry.gif

The last two questions have been basically answered in my above work!

I would guess u want to see my maps so... here u are! (this is all i could muster up right now, lol)

Hello, my name is AidenX, as you have most likely noticed in my topic, and I am requesting for a job as a Mapper.

1. I live in the Central Time Zone and am usually on early in the morning around 6am-7am. Then in the afternoon I am on around 3pm-6pm, and finally late at night around 8pm-12pm. Now those are when I am on the most. I usually play more often then that.

2. I believe I deserve this staff position because I believe that I can make a difference in the appearance in Inoca Online. I believe that I am a very creative person and you would enjoy my work. I also believe that I am able to work as a team with other fellow mappers and players. I can also help in the story line, and create fun and challenging quests. I am looking forward to seeing what test you put me up to, so I hope I can please you with my ‘art’.

3. I have some experience with mapping with other non-online games. But I must say that this seems very similar and different in some ways. I think that with a chance, I would learn how to better use the tools and create better things.

4. I think I can bring a fun, exciting, and challenging world to Inoca Online. I hope you will give me a shot, and I hope I don’t let you down.

I am fifteen years old. I am pretty sure I have good grammatical skills. I am very nice to players, and I don’t think I have ever been a nuisance. I don’t think I have ever blown my temper at someone when things don’t go right. And I think if you give me a chance at mapping I can gain more experience.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I will wait for your word.
