There are several different types of chest available to admins to add re-spawning quest items to. Type these commands in-game to drop one of the chests...

/drop water chest
/drop gold chest
/drop dark chest
/drop wind chest
/drop emerald chest
/drop steel chest

then open up your /DAT/QUESTCHEST folder and there should be text files for each chest, if there's NOT, then add the file. for example, create the text file: dark chest.txt for a dark chest.

Any item you put in this text file will randomly spawn over time. If you add more than 1 item it will randomly add one of those items.
