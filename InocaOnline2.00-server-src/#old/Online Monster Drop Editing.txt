FSO allows you to edit what monsters drop online.

Go to the NPC editor and load one of the monsters. To set what they drop add a line like this:

INV|Short Sword:10

this will have this monster (or NPC) drop a short sword at a random 10 when it is killed. TO ensure a monster drops 5 gold every time it's killed, add this line:

INV|5 Gold:1

You can have monsters and NPCs drop any amount of items you wish. Here is a good mutant worm script:

INV|300 Gold:20
INV|Steel Shield:40
INV|500 Gold:50
INV|Argon's Plate:100
