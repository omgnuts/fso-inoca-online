YOURGAMEHERE Server Installation/Running Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------

First and foremost, make sure you install the server into this directory:

C:/FSOServer/

If you don't, your DAT files will not be read. If you unzip this file to your C: drive you should have no problems. 

To start up the server simply double click on "MultiuserServer.exe"

Once the server has started up you can use the YOURGAMEHERE client to log-in and test out your server.

As an admin you can change the game world however you see fit. When you log-in under an admin name you'll notice that you have an "Admin" menu-item. Use this to edit the game world.
