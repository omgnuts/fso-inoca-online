HUNGER
You get hungry over time. You must eat to end your hunger. If you do not eat then your hit points won't regenerate after you become starving. The only way to cure hunger if you have no food is to die.

How can you make sure you have a good food supply? Some monsters will drop food when they die, so concentrate on slaying those if your food supply is dwindling. Certain markets sell cooked food so locate those and stock up when you can. You may also opt to fish or farm to increase your food supply. Those options are handy when you want to prepare your own food to work on your cooking skill, and as a bonus you'll be able to work on more than one skill at a time. For example, if you fish in order to cook then you'll be working on your fishing and cooking skills simaltaenously. The higher you can get your fishing and farming skills, the less likely you will be to starve to death in the future since you'll always have those skills to fall back on to stock up on food when times are hard.
