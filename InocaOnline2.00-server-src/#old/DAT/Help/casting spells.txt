CASTING SPELLS
Before you can cast a spell, you will first need to attain it. You can purchase spell books in Magic Shops in order to learn new spells. To cast a spell, first click on the "spells" tab then highlight the spell you wish to cast. Next, click the cast icon (below the list which shows a yellow character with a blue swirl around him) and then click on the screen where you want to cast the spell. If you have the required crystals for the spell, it will then be cast.
