Once you are in the world editor, you will notice a few new buttons.

On the left side you see buttons labeled: 1, 2, 3, S, with 1 being selected. 

These are the layers you will be drawing tiles onto. Layer 1 is the "floor" layer. It has no transparency. Layer 2 is the bottom transparent layer. Any tiles you see with green edges represent tiles that should be applied to layer 2. Layer 3 is the top layer, any tiles you place here will appear on top of all characters. The S layer is the shadow layer. In the last set of tiles you'll see black and green tiles. Use these to place shadows on your map.

Above the tiles you'll see you have 3 paint tools. Pencil, which draws in 1 tile at a time, praintbucket, which fills the screen with the selected tile, and fat brush, which paints a portion of the screen with the selected tile.
